    <h1>About me</h1>
    <p>
        
        Hello, my name is Risham. I am an enthusiastic and curious individual who has recently embarked on the journey of learning 
        web development. As a beginner, I am passionate about understanding the fundamentals and exploring the 
        exciting world of creating interactive and user-friendly websites. Currently, I am focusing on mastering HTML,
        the essential building block of web content. In my free time, I enjoy playing football and swimming, activities that
        allow me to stay active, build teamwork skills, and unwind.
        I value meaningful connections and enjoy engaging in conversations that offer different perspectives,
         especially those that challenge me to think differently about technology and design.
        I believe in continuous learning and personal growth, always seeking to better myself and contribute 
        positively to the projects I work on and the community around me. I'm excited to meet new people, 
        tackle new challenges, and embark on new adventures as I grow in the field of web development.
